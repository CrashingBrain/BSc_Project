1. Motivation
% Gives the intuition from QM and explain the bridge between
% the two theories. Formulate the question at high level.
% analogies, like privacy <-> entanglement
%                 complete correlation -> pure entanglement
% from a common secret we can extract a key
% there are Qstates that can not produce keys -> distribution with correlations but no key
  % Secret Key Exchange
  % two words on a very high level explaining the idea
  % of secret keys exchange (=> bound information is about (not) being
  % able to extract keys...)
# There are a lot of ideas here but I don't see what you think should be the line of thought... maybe you could order them?
  1.1 A comparison between securities
    % Temporarely here until I find a right chapter for this
    % This to give an idea of what theoretical securerity is,
    % compared to other kinds of security approaches
    1.1.1 Computational Complexity (Diffie-Hellman)
    1.1.2 Based on Laws of Physics (BB84)
    1.1.3 Information Theoretical security (Shannon/one-time pad)

2. Foundamentals
% lay out mathematical concepts needed/used in the next chapter.
% Or formalize some aspects.
  2.1 Mathematical Framework (for QM)
# 2.1.1???
  % inner product spaces, tensor product spaces,
  % linear operators, self-adjoint operators
    % Dirac notation here?
    % it is useful to then write operators and such
    2.1.2 Inner Product
# Do you want to put here more than just a definition?
    2.1.3 Linear Operators
# What goes here? Hermitian, unitary operators? Decompositions? ...
  2.2 Quantum Mechanics
    % Dirac notation here?
    2.2.1 Quantum Measurements
    % not sure it's needed
# How do you mean? Well: I think you can do with just quantum entanglement (I think that's what I did in my thesis)
    2.2.2 Quantum Entanglement
    % add also bound entagnglement probably
    % not sure how to explain BE yet. Is still very complicated to me. (the origin)
# This will need some notion of distillation already... PPT is quite intuitive I think
  2.3 Information Theory
    2.3.1 Mutual Information
      2.3.1.1 Conditional Mutual Information
    2.3.2 Common Secret (a.k.a. CKA)
    % The end result we want to achieve at the end of the protocol.
    % The thing we prove or disprove that is extractable form a distribution
  2.4 Quantum Distillation and Key Extraction
  % explain the princpiple and how they relate
# What principle?
  % Title can also be "Quantum information theory", to follow up from the others?
# Depends on what you want to put here...

3. Bound Information
  3.1 Conjectures
  % What the question would imply. What is speculated
  % Taken mostly from Gisin, Wolf paper
# I guess there will be an overlap with the following section
  3.2 State of research
  % brief summaries of foundings in following papers:
# Findings
  %   Linking classical and quantum key agreement: is there "bound Information"?
  %   New bounds in secret-key agreement: The gap between formation and secrecy extraction
  %   Multipartite bound information exists and can be activated
  %   (Gaussian multipartite bound information)
  %   ...
  3.3 The Bounds of Bound Information
  % maybe here is too late (since they are mentioned
  %  from the beginning in the question)?
# I think so too... I guess somewhere you will have to introduce all the concepts to approach the question... maybe it's better to tell a story going from one concept to the next to finally formulate the open questions/conjectures and explain the current results
    3.3.1 Secret key rate
    3.3.2 Intrinsic Information
  3.4 Analysis of a probability distribution asymptotically bound information
