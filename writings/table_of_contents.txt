1. Motivation
% Gives the intuition from QM and explain the bridge between
% the two theories. Formulate the question at high level.
  1.1 Secret Key Exchange
  % maybe two words on a very high level explaining the idea 
  % of secret keys exchange (=> bound information is about (not) being
  % able to extract keys...)
  1.2 A comparison between securities
    % This to give an idea of what theoretical securerity is,
    % compared to other kinds of security approaches
    1.2.1 Computational Complexity (Diffie-Hellman)
    1.2.2 Based on Laws of Physics (BB84)
    1.2.3 Information Theoretical security (Shannon/one-time pad)

2. Foundamentals
  2.1 Mathematical Framework (for QM)
    2.1.1 Notation
    2.1.2 Inner Product
    2.1.3 Linear Operators
  2.2 Quantum Mechanics
    2.2.1 Quantum Measurements 
    % not sure it's needed
    2.2.2 Quantum Entanglement
  2.3 Information Theory
    2.3.1 Mutual Information
      2.3.1.1 Conditional Mutual Information
    2.3.2 Common Secret

3. Bound Information
  3.1 Conjectures
  % What the question would imply. What is speculated
  3.2 State of research
  % brief summaries of foundings in following papers:
  %   Linking classical and quantum key agreement: is there "bound Information"?
  %   New bounds in secret-key agreement: The gap between formation and secrecy extraction
  %   Multipartite bound information exists and can be activated    
  %   (Gaussian multipartite bound information)
  %   ...
  3.3 Quantum Distillation and Key Extraction
  % explain the princpiple and how they relate
  3.4 The Bounds of Bound Information
  % maybe here is too late (since they are mentioned
  %  from the beginning in the question)?
    3.4.1 Secret key rate
    3.4.2 Intrinsic Information
  3.5 Analysis of a probability distribution asymptotically bound information
