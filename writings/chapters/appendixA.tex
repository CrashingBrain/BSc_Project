	Unless stated otherwise, we consider each coefficient to be complex (as in elements of $\mathbb{C}$). Vectors have complex components.
	\section{Inner product spaces}
	In standard vector notation we define the inner (scalar) product of complex vectors as
	\begin{equation*}
	 ( \vec{v}, \vec{w} ) =  \begin{pmatrix} \bar{v_1} & \bar{v_2}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \bar{w_1} & \bar{w_2}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = ( \vec{w}, \vec{v} )^{\dagger}
	\end{equation*}
	Where $\dagger$ represents the conjugate transpose.\\
%	This property is fundamental in the sense that it will allows us to go from a state space --- that can be many dimensional --- to a \textit{measurement} space, which assumes real values.\\ %0 and 1 in our case??
	
	It is important also to note that through the inner product of two vectors we also define the norm $\|\ket{v}\|  =  \sqrt{( \vec{v}, \vec{v} )} $.\\
	
	\section{Tensor product spaces}
	The tensor product $V\otimes W$ is an operation between vector spaces that combines every element of the first vector space and every element of the second vector space in a bigger vector space. Tensor product is linear and from its properties emerges the famous phenomenon of quantum entanglement, which simply is that not all vectors in $\H = V\otimes W$ can be divided into $\ket{v}\otimes\ket{w}$ with $\ket{v}\in V,\; \ket{w}\in W$. This will later be explained in the next section.
	Notation and abbreviation for the tensor product is 
	$$ \ket{v}\otimes\ket{w} = \ket{v}\ket{w} = \ket{v,w} = \ket{vw}$$
	It has the following properties:
	\begin{align*}
		 \forall\ket{v}\in V ,\; \forall\ket{w}\in W, \; \forall z\in \mathbb{C}&\\
					&z(\ket{v}\otimes\ket{w}) = (z\ket{v})\otimes\ket{w} = \ket{v}\otimes(z\ket{w} \\
		\forall\ket{v_1},\ket{v_2}\in V ,\; \forall\ket{w}\in W	&\\
					 &(\ket{v_1} + \ket{v_2})\otimes\ket{w} = \ket{v_1w} + \ket{v_2w} \\
		\forall\ket{v}\in V ,\; \forall\ket{w}\in W, \; A:V\rightarrow V' \; B:W\rightarrow W'&\\
					&(A\otimes B) \left(\sum_i a_i \ket{v_i w_i} \right) = \sum_i a_i A\ket{v_i}\otimes B\ket{w_i} 
	\end{align*}
	The inner product on $V$ and $W$ can be used to define (linearly) an inner product on $V\otimes W$.
