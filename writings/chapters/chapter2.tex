			Bound entanglement is a kind of correlation between Alice and Bob inaccessible to Eve but neverthenless of no use for generating a secret (quantum) key.\\
			Unfortunately the existence of such bound information, which would contradict the mentioned conjecture\footnotemark on the classical side of the picture, could not be proven so far.

Maurer+Wolf: \emph{Intrinsic information} between $A$ and $B$ given $E$ == \emph{secret key rate}(how much key can Alice and Bob generate from that $P_{ABE}$).}
