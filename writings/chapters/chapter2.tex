\section{What is a shared key?}
    	\subsection{Common Secret} \label{commonsecret}%here?
	Let $X,Y,Z,S$ be random variables on the same range $\mathcal{X}$. Let $X$ be owned by Alice, $Y$ by Bob and $Z$ by Eve. Then
  \begin{align}
	 & P[X=Y=S] > 1 - \epsilon\label{eqn:common}\tag{common} \\ 
	 & I(X;Z) = 0 \: \wedge \: I(Y;Z) = 0 \label{eqn:secret}\tag{secret}
  \end{align}
for all $\epsilon > 0 $. \\
The first part defines the \textit{common} property: $X$ and $Y$ must be asymptotically the same. 
The second part states that the amount of information Eve can gather about $X$ and $Y$, through it's realization of $Z$, is $0$.
