\section{Conjectures}
		% Here you can retake the examples of protocols in chapter 1. After explaining Maurer postulate, show that they don't violate Maurer because of reasons.
		\begin{quotation}
			Bound entanglement is a kind of correlation between Alice and Bob inaccessible to Eve but nevertheless of no use for generating a secret (quantum) key.\\
			Unfortunately the existence of such bound information, which would contradict the mentioned conjecture\footnotemark on the classical side of the picture, could not be proven so far.

		\footnotetext{Shannon states that information theoretical security can be achieved only by parties sharing an unconditionally secret key initially. Maurer added also that this key can not be generated from scratch. Maurer+Wolf: \emph{Intrinsic information} between $A$ and $B$ given $E$ == \emph{secret key rate}(how much key can Alice and Bob generate from that $P_{ABE}$).}
