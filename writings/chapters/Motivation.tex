The goal of key exchange is to allow Alice and Bob to establish a secure, private channel for communication.
For two parties to communicate confidentially, it is first needed to share some secret key between them, so that each party can encrypt and decrypt the communication.
If two parties could not establish a secure --- as in information theoretic secure --- initial key exchange, they cannot communicate with absolute security without the risk of an eavesdropper Eve listening to them.
The ultimate goal of Alice and Bob is to achieve a level of privacy, such that no eavesdropper could have information about the communication, even partially.\\
%The tools or \emph{resources} to obtain such initial common secret can have many shapes and forms in modern telecommunication, often relying on computer science.\\

It has been noticed that these concepts of privacy also appear in nature and the strongest analogy comes from quantum mechanics.\footnotemark 
From this theory arises the famous \emph{quantum entanglement} that appears to be the equivalent of privacy in many ways.
Both phenomena are composed of correlations between known parties that no other person can access or copy. As summed in \cite{4H07} "If systems are in pure entangled state then at the same time (i) systems are correlated and (ii) no other system is correlated with them."
This can be seen as Alice and Bob holding a secret that Eve cannot get to know.

\footnotetext{While those analogies are present in many sources, they can be found summed up in the paper by Collins and Popescu \cite{CP02}, which also shortly addresses the question of bound information. }

From table \ref{Tab:analogy} we see that some of the resources and operations of QM have a bijective analog in classical information theory. 
Such a (close) relation suggests that the two theories can be viewed together and to use one to better understand the other. 
It is important however to point out that quantum entanglement and its effects \emph{are not} a quantum manifestation of classical effects and one theory does not prove the other.
There are limitations to the correspondences. 
For example there is no known instance --- and it is believed to not exist -- of a classical correspondence to super-dense coding (a quantum effect). Other entities like a classical correspondence to bound entanglement, \emph{bound information}, are not excluded a priori and remain yet to be observed or disproved.

An open question has remained over the years asking whether bound information exists in the classical regime.
Should this resource exists, it would be --- by definition --- unusable to generate any key from it.
Nevertheless the existence of a resource with bound information might lead to interesting bounds on information theoretical key exchange.
To summarize, we are interested in the following question:

\paragraph*{The Question}
\begin{itemize}
		\item[] Is there a tripartite probability $P_{ABE}$, corresponding to Alice and Bob wanting to establish a key unknown to Eve, that has some \emph{cost} associated to it to create it, but has $0$ possible key bits extractable from it? 
\end{itemize}
