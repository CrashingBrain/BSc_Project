\section{A Comparison between Securities}
% begin expalining that you want to share a secret within parties
% give broad definition of a common secret (in words) it will later
% be explained in next chapter -> ... A more formal and precise definition of a \textit{common secret} is given in section [XX]

	\subsection{Security Bounded by Computational Complexity}
	
		\subsubsection{The Diffie-Hellman key exchange}
		% Expalin only ho w the protocol works, what is based on, what are its bounds, how it can be attacked (ideally).
		% Don't dive into Maurer violations, that will be covered in chapter [3] (XX)
	
	\subsection{Security Bounded by the Laws of Physics}
	
		\subsubsection{The BB84 protocol}
	
	\subsection{Information Theoretical Security}
	
		\subsubsection{The One-time Pad}
		%this is not really a method to share a common secret, since you have 
		% to already start with a secret.. <- point that out!
