\section{The abstraction through random variables}
    We have used many times the idea of \textit{factoring out} the enemy in the previous chapter, but we never actually expressed what we meant with that.
    In order to make reasoning like this it is needed to model the concepts of \textit{message} and \textit{information first} in a computation-able way.\\
    In classical information theory a message is defined as a repetition of an experiment on radon variables with a (joint) probability distribution $P_{X_1X_2\ldots X_n}$.
    The range of the random variable $X$ is the size of the alphabet with which we are communicating.
    For example if the message is written in English the alphabet is composed of $26$ letters, or $62$ if we include numbers and upper and lower case letters.
    The probability of a word in a message can be given, for example, by the frequency of that word in the English language.
    Moreover, the probability of a word (or letter) to follow another can be dependent on the previous realizations of $P$.\\
    Probability theory provides rules and operations to manipulate and observe these probability distributions.
    The most important for us are the entropy $\Ent (X)$, the correlation and mutual information $\I(X;Y)$ of random variables or the marginal $P_X$ of joint probabilities $P_{XY}$.
    
    Now the idea of "factoring out Eve" takes the meaning of obtaining 
    $$P_{XYZ} = P_{XY}\cdot P_Z$$
    so that the marginal of $P_{XYZ}$ over $Z$ --- i.e. the part of the distribution owned by Eve --- is now \emph{independent} from variables $X$ and $Y$.
    
\section{Local operations and public communication}
    By local operations and public communication we mean operations carried out on $P_{XYZ}$ representing our variables.
    We can mix different distributions together or trace out the marginal.
    Communicating over a channel is, in nature, noisy. 
    That noise is also a form of operations on the probability distribution.
    
\section{Secret key rate} \label{seckeyrate}
    %[1]
    The secret key rate $\keyrate{X}{Y}{Z}$ is roughly the maximal amount of correlated bits between Alice and Bob extractable from an arbitrarily large number of realizations of a distribution $P_{XYZ}$.
