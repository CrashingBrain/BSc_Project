#### Abstract

There is a correspondence between entanglement distillation in quantum mechanics and classical key agreement in information theory. In the quantum- mechanical framework there are, furthermore, non-distillable, but entangled quantum states — that is, states sharing bound entanglement. So, consider- ing the above analogy, does there exists some notion of bound information? As of today this remains an open question. In this project we follow the intuition from bound entanglement, the related measures and their connections to concepts of classical key agreement, as well as related information-theoretical concepts, in order to further investigate this open question. We also look at a candidate probability distribution for bound information and perform numerical simulations in search for new, possibly better, candidates for bound information.
